## Julian George

I am a Software Developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy, with 16 years of previous experience working in the IT sector. 

I decided earlier this year that now was the time to take on a new challenge.  After rekindling my interest in software development through online courses, books, blogs, podcasts, and speaking with any developer I could find, I decided to make the jump. I enroled on a 12-week full-time coding Bootcamp at Makers.

I have thrived during the immersive and demanding course.  I particularly enjoyed working collaboratively with equally ambitious, focused and fun people.

Being a great dev means you never stop learning.  I am continuing my development by working on my own projects while looking forward to joining a team building larger-scale commercial projects.

## Skills

#### Team Work

I took the lead to ensure all areas of the business would be GDPR compliant.  The process began with reviewing GDPR policy and drafting a plan of action to be reviewed by a solicitor.  I then assessed the practicalities of the intention of work with relevant staff.  I then implemented a program, including new data storage and information processing policies and drafted privacy notice.

#### Project Management

I set up three online sales channels and added the first 500 products to inventory for all three platforms (with the assistance of an outsourced developer).  The business is now selling 1,000+ products on four online platforms.  The online platforms have completed over 10,000+ transactions while maintaining at least 99% positive customer feedback.
