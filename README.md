<br>I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer and Makers Academy graduate, ready to write clean code with TDD and work in Agile teams.  With 16 years of previous experience working in the IT sector, I'm also commercially aware.

I decided that now is the time to take on a new challenge.  After rekindling my interest in software development through online courses, books, blogs, podcasts, and speaking with any developer I could find, I decided to make the jump and enrolled at Makers.

I've thrived during the immersive and demanding course and particularly enjoyed working collaboratively with equally ambitious, focused and fun people.

Being a great dev means you never stop learning.  I'm continuing my development by working on personal projects with JavaScript, Express, Node, Jest, Cypress and API's. I'm  now looking forward to joining a team building larger-scale commercial projects.

## Skills

####  :ear:Communication

In a previous role, I took the lead to ensure all areas of the business would be GDPR compliant. The process began with reviewing GDPR policy and drafting a plan of action to be reviewed by a solicitor. I then assessed the impact it would have staff. Finally, I implemented a program, including new data storage and information processing policies and drafted privacy notice.  As with most businesses, there was a significant consideration given to how technology interacts with data held by the company.  The process was a great lesson in gaining awareness of how information is stored and processed by software.

####  :open_file_folder:Project Management

In a previous role, I set up three online sales channels and added the first 500 products to inventory.  The business is now selling 1,000+ products on four online platforms.  Once set up, I oversaw the online platforms which completed 10,000+ transactions globally while maintaining at least 99% positive customer feedback.

####  :white_check_mark:Test Driven Development

A fundamental taught at Makers is TDD. It's something I've found valuable as I progressed through the course. I like TDD because it encourages refactoring. So when you've completed writing your code, it is optimal. I've improved my TDD through regular practice. I attended process workshops where you solve a problem within a time constraint. You then receive feedback about your process, so you know how to improve next time. 

Another form of practice was external reviews. These are completed with a code review professional.  The problem is presented to you verbally, and you also need to clarify requirements before working on a solution.  You then receive feedback on your process.

## Interests

:airplane: Travel - I love experiencing anything different from my usual surroundings, from a walk in the New Forest to a few days in Las Vegas.  While experiencing all parts of different cultures is great, I particularly enjoy trying new food.

:soccer: Football - I love to put my optimistic nature to the test as a life long Arsenal fan.

:mortar_board: I mentor two Makers Academy students.
