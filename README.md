I'm a Full Stack Software Developer, and as a recent Makers Academy graduate, I'm ready to write clean code with TDD and work in Agile teams.  With 16 years of previous experience working in the IT sector, I'm also commercially aware.

I decided earlier this year that now was the time to take on a new challenge.  After rekindling my interest in software development through online courses, books, blogs, podcasts, and speaking with any developer I could find, I decided to make the jump and enrolled at Makers.

I have thrived during the immersive and demanding course and particularly enjoyed working collaboratively with equally ambitious, focused and fun people.

Being a great dev means you never stop learning.  I'm continuing my development by working on personal projects while looking forward to joining a team building larger-scale commercial projects.

## Skills

#### Team Work

In a previous role, I took the lead to ensure all areas of the business would be GDPR compliant. The process began with reviewing GDPR policy and drafting a plan of action to be reviewed by a solicitor. I then assessed the impact it would have staff. Finally, I implemented a program, including new data storage and information processing policies and drafted privacy notice.

#### Project Management

In a previous role, I set up three online sales channels and added the first 500 products to inventory.  The business is now selling 1,000+ products on four online platforms.  Once set up, I oversaw the online platforms which completed 10,000+ transactions globally while maintaining at least 99% positive customer feedback.

## Interests

Travel - I love experiencing anything different from my usual surroundings, from a walk in the New Forest to a few days in Las Vegas.  While experiencing all parts of different cultures is great, I particularly enjoy trying new food.

Football - I love to put my optimistic nature to the test as a life long Arsenal fan.

I mentor two Makers Academy students.
