## Julian George

I am a full-stack developer with a passion for writing clean and readable code.  Having embarked on a 12-week full-time software engineering course with Makers Academy, I'm progressing to become confident and highly competent full-stack software developer and a team player.

## Skills

#### Team Work

I took the lead to ensure all areas of the business would be GDPR compliant.  The process began with reviewing GDPR policy and drafting a plan of action to be reviewed by a solicitor.  I then assessed the practicalities of the intention of work with relevant staff.  I then implemented a program, including new data storage and information processing policies and drafted privacy notice.

#### Project Management

I set up three online sales channels and added the first 500 products to inventory for all three platforms (with the assistance of an outsourced developer).  The business is now selling 1,000+ products on four online platforms.  The online platforms have completed over 10,000+ transactions while maintaining at least 99% positive customer feedback.
